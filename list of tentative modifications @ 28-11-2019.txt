Things to be defined:
ask to Pasquale:
- namespaces: keep getfem or change?
- abstract class: good practice to have protected constructor?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Modifications already implemented @29.11:
- now init is only virtual, while its subroutines are pure virtual. The user can define eventually unused methods to empty. By default, it executes all pure virtual subroutines.
- now log_data is a protected data member of quantum graph problem.
- now all headers in FEMG have doxy-like comments.
- now init also runs a set_default_coefficient methods (pure virtual method in quantum graph)
- now unused data structures are cleaned, aside of coeffbranchg (maybe to be cleaned)
- now radii and output "descriptors" are in descr_qg and not in child structs. Updated print and import routines accordingly.
- now RFILE is read only if IMPORT_RADIUS = 1.
- now ITER is read as an integer, instead of as a real.
- now set_coefficients(args) is a pure virtual method in quantum_graph_problem that gets overridden and overloaded.
  set_source(args) is always called for clarity purposes.
- now invalid descriptors throw a GMM exception

Possible modifications to do:
- delete mf_coeffbranchg

Definitely to be done:
- add const keywords if correct
- beautify .param. Insert comments, flag that COMP_METHOD is case sensitive or implement something
- insert box with authors and "copyright"
- check if solve can return False and update main.cpp
- insert well-posedness check in elliptic_problem
- polish verbose mode
- readme files on git
- comment a little more .cpp files
