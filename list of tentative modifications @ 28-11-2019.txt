Things to be defined:
- namespaces: keep getfem or change?
- abstract class: good practice to have protected constructor?
- structure of init procedure: possibly modify, in quantumproblem, virtual init but not = 0, while aux methods pure virtual 
  (import data, build mesh, ecc...)
- found duplicate definition of auxiliary methods in qgproblem.hpp and eigen_problem.hpp, to be corrected
- radii: data structure in quantum graph, but input structure in eigen_problem, to be uniformed
- cleaned useless data structures in eigen_problem.hpp (potential "matrix" duplicate)
- mf_coeffbranchg used?
- log_data possibly to be shifted in quantum_graph_problem.hpp
- create function to set coefficient to default?
- altro...
