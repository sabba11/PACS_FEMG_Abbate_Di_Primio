% Graphene graph generator
%
% This script generates a simple graphene graph in a .txt (giving edges with
% initial and final points coordinates with boundary conditions afterwards).
% It is a 2 dimensional graph in the box [0,L;0,L] made by two exagon
% linked by an edge
% The setting and the points are saved as like as it is a 3d graph
%
% Input parameters:
% out_filename = name of the output file. Put it in the ./data folder.
%     ndim    = dimension of the problem (in this case is 2)
%       L      = length of the box containing the graphene
