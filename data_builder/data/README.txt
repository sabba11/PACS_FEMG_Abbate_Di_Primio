In this folder we find the data of the geometries of the graphs.

The file are saved as *.txt built using Matlab scripts containing
the lists of the edges (starting point, last point and BC)

Then there are the extended meshed graphs saved in *.pts files
The name are the same of the *.txt but with the addition of a number
that it is telling how many internal points there are for each edge.
If you find two or more numbers in the name of the file this info is
always contained in the last number.
